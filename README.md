## Running Tutorial 1
Download and extract this GitHub repository by cloning it or downloading [the archive](https://github.com/beiko-lab/2020-BioinformaticsAlgorithms/archive/master.zip).

GitHub helpfully renders [the Tutorial1_KNN.ipynb file](https://github.com/beiko-lab/BioinformaticsAlgorithms/blob/master/Tutorial1_KNN.ipynb) in your web browser. This document contains information for downloading Python 3.6 and the Jupyter notebook software that is required for completing this tutorial. This information is under the "Software Pre-requisites" section. Once Python and Jupyter have been installed, open the Tutorial1_KNN.ipynb file with the Jupyter Notebook application. We will go over this step in the tutorial on Monday, January 27th, 2020.
